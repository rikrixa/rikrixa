### Rikhiya Ghosh here! 👋

I work on problems related to Counter masquerading, which involves Automated Reasoning, NLP, NLG and Sentiment Analysis.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I actually have extensively worked with [Nao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nao_(robot))
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Deep Learning and Logic based systems to solve Mathematical Theorems.
